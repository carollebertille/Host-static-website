  + Amazon s3 is simple storage service where we can store different types of data. For example, Analytics data, logs files, application data, videos and pictures,   and  backup and archival can be stored on S3. When it comes to hosting static websites, S3 is a great choice too.
  + When you upload a document to S3, it provides a unique URL through which you will access it 
 
  + AWS CloudFront service is used to create CDN which 
     + improve page load speeLoad balance between multiple servers
     + Protect your website from DDoS attacks
     + Secure your application (TLS/HTTPS)
